                        <p>Women own a third of the worldâ€™s businesses, according to the World Bank. But if you think about the largest and most successful companies on the planet, most of those were founded by men. The truth is that while women often start their own businesses, they can struggle to scale them and transform them into the corporate behemoths that end up becoming household names.</p>
                        <p>Being a female entrepreneur can even be a disadvantage in the talent marketplace since prospective employees may use gender as a reason to question the competence and leadership qualities of a female founder.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All around, then, female entrepreneurs tend to face more barriers than their male counterparts.</li>

                            <li>Discuss the motivation of female entrepreneurs</li>
                            <li>Discuss the attributes of successful entrepreneurs and business ventures in line with the modern perspective of a successful organization - female entrepreneurs in view.</li>
